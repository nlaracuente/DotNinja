# DotNinja
Is our entry for the [Extra Credits Game Jam #4](https://itch.io/jam/extra-credits-game-jam-4/rate/432222) where the theme was "Connect."

## Description
The first ting that came to mind was a "connect the dots" like game where you control a dot that connects with other dots to form a path and move aroud. The idea morphed into a ninja in the shape of a dot that uses a grappling hook to connect with targets on the walls to move around the room collecting keys to unlock the exit
